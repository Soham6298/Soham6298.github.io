I am a Research Assistant at the [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/) and a final year Doctoral Researcher at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/) as an [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/) scholar. I am supervised by [Paul Bürkner](https://paulbuerkner.com/) and [Manfred Claassen](https://claassenlab.github.io/).

In my PhD, I have been working on Latent variable estimation using derivative Gaussian processes (GPs) and generalizing Hilbert space approximation methods for applications in single-cell biology. My research interests are largely in developing statistical methods and Bayesian inference. My current interests lie in latent temporal models, spatial statistics and prior specifications for covariance functions. Recently, Bayesian change-point point analysis of latent temporal processes has peaked my interest. Over the years, I have grown a special interest in statistical applications to Single-cell biology, especially in modelling biological processes. Being a shared PhD between a computational statistics lab and a ML in single-cell biology lab, my skills and interest towards as an interdisciplinary researcher has grown quite a bit. I am currently on the lookout for postdoctoral opportunities that align with the above areas of research. I would be happy to connect and discuss about potential positions and collaboration.

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:sohammukherjee1998@gmail.com:) for potential collaboration and/or for more information about my ongoing works.
