    "text": "I am a Research Assistant at the TU Dortmund and a final year Doctoral Researcher at the University of Tübingen as an IMPRS-IS scholar. I am co-supervised by Paul Bürkner and Manfred Claassen. My educational background is in statistical theory and methods.\nCapturing the uncertainty is a cornerstone of statistical inference. In my PhD, I tackle one of the directions of the overarching uncertainty quantification field through developing latent variable estimation methods using Gaussian processes (GPs) and Bayesian inference. Currently I am working on approximation methods for latent variable GPs for analysis of large sampled and high-dimensional RNA sequencing data in the field of single-cell biology. My research interests are largely in developing statistical methods and Bayesian inference. My current interests, among others, lie in latent temporal models and I have been looking for an opportunity to extending my methods into the spatial statistics domain. An interest that grew organically from my ongoing works are in prior specifications, which is one of the big areas of research in Bayesian inference. Quite recently I also got interested in Bayesian change-point point analysis using GPs.\nI usually enjoy working on topics that involve a mix of theory and methodology, however, being a shared PhD between a computational statistics lab and a ML in single-cell biology lab, I have also cultivated my skills and interest on the applied side of research. While the application of my works have been associated with statistical methods in biology, I am also interested in other areas like astro-statistics. I am currently on the lookout for postdoctoral opportunities that align with any of the above areas of research (both methods and applications). I would be happy to connect and discuss about potential positions and collaboration.\nFeel free to get in touch for potential collaboration and/or for more information about my ongoing works."
